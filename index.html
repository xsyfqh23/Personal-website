                    <p>My educational journey began here, in this Kindergarten, when I was five years old in 2006. 
                    I had a lot of fun here because I met a lot of new people, and I still remember that the teachers at 
                    this kindergarten taught me how to dance! It was both exciting and enjoyable.</p>

                        I was invited by the teachers to be one of the prefects at the school when I was eight years old, 
                        and I held that position until I graduated, at the age of twelve. 
                        I graduated as a primary school student with an excellent <b><i><abbr title="Ujian Penilaian Sekolah Rendah"> UPSR</b></i></abbr> results.</p>
